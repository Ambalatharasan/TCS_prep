You are given an integer array nums consisting of n elements, and an integer k.

Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to k that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than 10-5 will be accepted.

Input Format

First line: An integer n representing the length of the array nums. Second line: n space-separated integers representing the elements of the array nums. Third line: An integer k representing the size of the subarray.

Constraints

n == nums.length 1 <= k <= n <= 105 -104 <= nums[i] <= 104

Output Format

A single line containing a floating-point number representing the maximum average value of a contiguous subarray of length k in the given array nums.
