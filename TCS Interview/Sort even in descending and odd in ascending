Imagine you are developing a utility for a software application that processes large datasets of integers. One of the features required is to sort these integers such that the even numbers are in descending order and the odd numbers are in ascending order. This feature is essential for a specific analytical task where the ordering of numbers based on their parity and magnitude provides meaningful insights.

Input Format

An integer n representing the number of elements in the array. An array of n integers.

Constraints

No Constraints

Output Format

A single line of space-separated integers representing the sorted array, where even numbers are in descending order, and odd numbers are in ascending order.
